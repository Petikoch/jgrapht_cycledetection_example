= Comparing JGraphT with jtwfg regarding cycle (deadlock) detection

== JGraphT, jtwfg ... wtf?

https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht[JGraphT] is a feature-rich java library with a long history,
focusing on graph data structures and algorithms.

https://github.com/Petikoch/jtwfg[jtwfg] is a small, standalone java library focusing just on finding deadlocks (cycles)
in directed graphs. jtwfg is pretty new (started in late 2014).

== Motivation

My name is Peti Koch. I'm the author of jtwfg and didn't know about JGraphT when I started jtwfg.
I wondered if JGraphT could solve the same problem as jtwfg and therefore jtwfg is obsolete and could be deleted.

== Analysis

I checked out the features of JGraphT using link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/examples/jgrapht/JGraphT_CycleDetection_Example.groovy[tests based on Groovy/Spock].

|Feature
|JGraphT
|jtwfg

|Determine if there are cycles or not in the graph
|*Yes*
|*Yes*

|Finding which tasks/vertexes are in a cycle
|*Yes*
|*Yes*

|Finding distinct cycles
|*No*
|*Yes*

|Finding tasks/vertexes outside of a cycle but dependent on a task/vertex which is in a cycle (these tasks/vertexes are also "deadlocked")
|*No*
|*Yes*

|*Thread-safety*: Building a graph concurrently using multiple threads
|*No*. Synchronization must be handled yourself (although not very tricky)
|*Yes*

== Summary

Puuhhh... there are some reasons to keep *jtwfg* and *not delete* it! ;-)
